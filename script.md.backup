[Hello, Good Morning][any salutation] everyone
I am Nibir and I am going to present the topic of Crunch in the Game Industry

So before we get started does anyone knows what the term crunch mean 

and I dont want the dictionary meaning of crunch

which is to crush a brittle or a hard food with teeth making a loud grinding sound.

which I presume everybody knows

I am asking about Crunch in realtion to the game industry

[open the stage up]

Crunch is a compulsory overtime that game developer have to put in during development of a game


## Slide 2: Defination of Crunch
- Define what crunch means in context of the game industry
- Explain that it refers to extended periods of overtime and high-pressure work to meet deadlines

Crunch in game industry refers to a intense and extended period of time in which game developers are expected to put in unsustainable work hours in high pressure work conditions 

> Crunch in the game industry refers to a period of intense, often extended, and unsustainable work hours 
> and high-pressure work conditions endured by video game developers,

a typpical work week is 40-hours in week 
where as crunch can lead to work weeks of 65–80 hours


and the work part this that this is just a uncomponsated overtime

a labour-intensive endeavour


Now the question comes why are we talking about crunch in the first place 

simple cause Prevalance of crunch in the game industry

## Slide 3: Prevalance of crunch

Crunch in common amoung the industry

Some of the biggest titles in gaming such as Fortnite and Red Dead Redemption 2 are the product of 70–100 hour work weeks


Terms such as "stress casualties" were coined at Bioware, the development studio for the game Anthem. A "stress casualty" is when an employee disappears for months at a time as a result of the stress that they are put under during crunch

Critics of crunch note how it has become normalized within the game-development industry,

## Slide 4: Causes of crunch
- Explain the factors that lead to crunch, such as tight release schedules, project scope changes, and mismanagement
- Emphasize the impact of marketing and financial pressures on game development


- Cost cutting measures
- Profit incentives
- deadline pressure

So we know that crunch is common in the industry but we have to ask why it is so prevelent in the industry

the first reason is that it is used as a way to cut the costs of game development,
game development is a really expensnsive endevour and requries a lot of money.
and that money comes from Investers who wants profit. so companies try to push their teams to work as much as possible to get more profit





and because it is a highly profitable industry
so companies try to push their teams to work as much as possible to get more profit




Deadline Pressure: One of the primary reasons for crunch culture is the pressure to meet strict release deadlines. Game companies often face intense competition, marketing schedules, and financial commitments tied to specific release dates. As a result, developers may be asked or feel compelled to work long hours to meet these deadlines.


Management Pressure: Management may inadvertently or intentionally create an environment where developers feel pressured to work excessive hours. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the consequences of crunch or an emphasis on short-term results.

The use of crunch time is also seen to be exploitative of the younger male-dominated workforce in video games, who have not had the time to establish a family and who were eager to advance within the industry by working long hours.[3][4] In some cases, the drive for crunch may come from the developers themselves as individual developers may want to work extra hours without a mandate to assure their product meets delivery milestones and is of high quality, which can influence other developers to also commit to extra hours or avoid taking time off as to appear slacking.[5]

Because crunch time tends to come from a combination of corporate practices as well as peer influence, the term "crunch culture" is often used to discuss video game development settings where crunch time may be seen as the norm rather than the exception.[6] It stems from an emphasis that getting work done well and done quickly is more important than work-life balance or personal well being.

The intense workload can partly be traced to a shift to a microtransaction model for games. in this model, the main game is free but add-ons and extra content such as skins that can change the character's appearance can be bought for an extra price.This emphasizes constant updates to keep creating more content so players stay attached which leads to perpetual crunch.


## Slide 5: Effects of Crunch
- Detail the negative consequences of crunch on game developers' physical and mental health
- Physical health effects (fatigue, sleep deprivation, etc.)
- Mental health effects (stress, anxiety, burnout)
- Discuss how crunch can affect the quality of games, leading to bugs and glitches
